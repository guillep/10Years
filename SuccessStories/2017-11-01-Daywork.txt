Daywork (*https://daywork.cz*) is a new czech web portal designed to simplify searching for temporary jobs and workers. Workers are notified of jobs matching their skills and requirements, reducing the effort needed to find the best one. Companies may select the right candidate based on rating and reviews from other companies.

The portal recently went into production and attracts more and more potential workers and companies.

Backend of the portal is developed in Pharo 6.1 and uses custom web framework Eleven - stateless alternative to Seaside. "Pharo allows us to seamlessly work on multiple platforms and live objects manipulation and debugging proved to be great help and time saver", said Jan Blizniƒçenko, lead developer of Daywork.
