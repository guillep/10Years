From 2008 to 2015 ATMs deployed in Moscow streets were developed and run using Pharo. People use them to pay for services with cash and cards (phone, internet, taxes, parking, etc).


"Pharo was a really enabling technology.  We developed user interfaces using advanced flow control based on continuations and mixed prototype with class-based programming. 
We supported various kind of equipment and allow customers to tune application look and feel preferred for their business.
Pharo lets us develop fast a reliable and flexible software system. Now we can say it publicly!‚Äù said Denis Kudriashov Chief architect.
